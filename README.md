# NetGAN-without-GAN
This repository contains Pytorch implementation of the paper [NetGAN without GAN:
From Random Walks to Low-Rank Approximations](https://www.tml.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/team/luxburg/publications/RensburgLuxburg_Netgan_without_Gan2020.pdf) and additional experiments of low-rank approximation of transformation matrix of random walks through graph.
